And this demo is based to his course and I strengthen and deepen in this demo.
Now you can shot for 2 kind of EnemyPlane and 1 bossPlane(they can bullet also and someone look strong,haha)
Not long after,I would deliver some course for this demo.And I really hope some good gay can point out some bugs in my demo,
